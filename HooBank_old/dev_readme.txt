Rules:
Write tailwind only
If you need something special like background use .css


Info
After writing this site I understood that:
<Component/> you write with .css
(if you change this .css file it changes across all site)
UNIQUE - you wirte with tailwind
(if you wirte css with tailwind it changes only for this section because 
you set it as componentClass which you wrote in props)
